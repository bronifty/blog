# Respect

There was a course I tried watching recently from one of the major universities whose prof spoke with a heavy accent and whose demeanor was heavy handed to his gsi. In section (i think they call it recitation), the graduate student instructor (i think they call them teaching assistants) was being snapped at and taunted by the students following suit of the professor's direction. It made the course on youtube unwatchable. I'm sure at least one person reading this has had a similar experience, either as the offender or the victim of this type of abuse. This culture of hostility is created at the direction of the relative top of the food chain because culture is pushed downward by management.
