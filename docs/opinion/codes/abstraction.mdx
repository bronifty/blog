# Abstraction

## Code Aesthetic: Never Nester

[code aesthetic never nester](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFRhGnuXG-4)
video provided a blueprint for function extraction and inversion with early return in order to avoid deeply nested code.

the same approach can be applied to abstraction in general.

## Fundamentals of Software Architecture Chapter 3

[fundamentals of software architecture chapter 3 - modularity notes](./fundamentals-ch3.mdx) describe a metric called distance from the main sequence. This compares abstraction to concreteness in the implementation of an application.

code aesthetic in his video suggests a hard boundary at 3 levels of nesting. i have always thought any abstract class is unnecessary and that a single interface contract is sufficient, like in golang. Likewise I think 3 levels of abstraction is the limit for programming.
