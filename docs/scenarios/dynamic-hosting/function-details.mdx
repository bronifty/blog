# Function Details

[github repo](https://github.com/bronifty/rspress-blog/tree/main/blog-app-examples/remix-lambda)

## Remix Server Function

We are going to create the most basic app with only 2 routes and a shared counter (code not state) to demonstrate deploying an ssr app with lambda and a bucket, routed by cloudfront.

:::tip
In an ssr app, there are 3 routers:

1. api GET and POST for initial load and actions/mutations on the route (ssr html with api data)
2. static assets for interactivity (server middleware or a bucket)
3. client browser history (push and pop state for that spa effect)

:::

```sh
npx create-remix@latest
```

## Lambda Function

The lambda function is a custom server entrypoint for the remix app which serves as a request handler for the server file in the build folder, which is imported as a module. This is the api router (#1 listed above in tip). If you'll notice, we have the middleware for static assets turned off / ghosted / commented out. We will instead use a bucket to host static assets (#2 listed above in tip). The 3rd router (client browser history) is handled by the react router functionality of remix itself.

Notably, we are importing the api server file, and creating a router from express which is passed to a package to format the event handling for lambda called serverless-http.

```js
// lambda.js
import { createRequestHandler } from "@remix-run/express";
import serverless from "serverless-http";
import express from "express";
import * as build from "./build/server/index.js";

const app = express();

// Serve static files from the client build directory
// app.use(express.static("build/client"));

// Handle all routes with the Remix request handler
app.all("*", createRequestHandler({ build }));

// // Create a serverless handler
const handler = serverless(app);

export { handler };
```

## Build Lambda Function

In order to deploy this, it will need to be built to a javascript node format that is compatible with lambda. We will use esbuild. Here is it's configuration.

```js
// esbuild.mjs
import * as esbuild from "esbuild";

await esbuild.build({
  entryPoints: ["lambda.js"],
  bundle: true,
  platform: "node",
  target: "node20",
  format: "cjs", // Change format to CommonJS
  outfile: "lambda.cjs", // Change output file extension to .cjs
  external: ["node:fs", "node:path", "node:crypto"],
});

console.log("Build complete");
```

## Package.json

By way of background, here are the package.json scripts I'm using for convenience to run the commands. Build runs the esbuild file. Test will create an entrypoint that passes an event to the serverless handler function. Zip puts the server files in an archive in a format that is compatible with lambda.

```json
"clean": "rm -rf build lambda.cjs lambda.zip",
"build": "pnpm clean && remix vite:build && node esbuild.mjs",
"test": "pnpm build && node ./test/local.js",
"zip": "zip -r lambda.zip lambda.cjs build"
```

## Local Test Harness (Validate App Router and Handler)

This uses a local event file for api gateway and cloudfront, which can be found in the accompanying repo mentioned up top.

```js
//local.js
import { serverlessHandler } from "../lambda.js";
import fs from "fs/promises";
import path from "path";

async function readJsonFile(filename) {
  const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), "events", filename);
  const data = await fs.readFile(filePath, "utf8");
  return JSON.parse(data);
}

const apigRequest = await readJsonFile("apig.json");
const cloudfrontRequest = await readJsonFile("cloudfront.json");

async function main(event) {
  const result = await serverlessHandler(event);
  console.log(result.body);
}

main(apigRequest);
main(cloudfrontRequest);
```

## Build

Lastly, the remix app will need to be built on the client and server. The esbuild handles the server, which outputs to lambda. Vite, as is currently managing remix, will run and bundle the client files (as well as the server file that the lambda imports).
